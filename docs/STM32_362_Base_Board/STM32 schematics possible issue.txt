Possible issue:
1) Different types of LED were used. Schematics of the original PDF file uses
solid filled LED symbol whereas the newly created schematics uses a hollow LED symbol.

2)Specifications of LED, ferrite beadr and nominal voltage are added using 'Place text' tool. I am not
certain if that is the correct way of labeling the specifications.
